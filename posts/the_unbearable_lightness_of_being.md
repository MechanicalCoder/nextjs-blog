## Notable Lines -

- In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the gullotine. [4]

- In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. [5] 

- The heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But in the love poetry of every age, the woman longs to be weighed down by the man's body. The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become. [5]

- *Einmal ist keinmal*, says Tomas to himself. What happens but once, say the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.
